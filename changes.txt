1. Initial - get list of tokens(token = keywords, (), {} -> skip content inside scopes) when given a reader that points to first character of first method
2. Add comment skipping - read commented out lines/multi line comments recursively and return when first non-commented character is found
3. Tokenize file - but class keyword and name of class added to list of tokens
4. Tokenize file without class/interface keyword added to file, and read through all classes in file - using inClass flag
5. Move tokenizer method to own class, and move logic of checking whether in class or outside class to seperate method. Return map of lists, key=class value=tokens

TODO:
1. Test current changes, configure tester class
